## Exercise 1
This program demonstrates creating a child process using fork(). The child prints its PID and the parent prints its own PID and the child's PID.

## Exercise 2
We run `sleep 300 &` to start a background process. This allows us to continue working in the terminal while the process runs in the background.

## Exercise 3
We find the PID with `ps aux | grep sleep` and use `kill <PID>` to stop the process.

## Exercise 4
`kill -STOP <PID>` pauses a process, and `kill -CONT <PID>` resumes it.

## Exercise 5
The linker connects compiled object files so function calls point to the correct definitions.

## Exercise 6
The loader loads the executable and all dynamic libraries into memory so it can run.
